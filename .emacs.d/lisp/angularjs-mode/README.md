# angularjs-mode for Emacs

If you're looking for snippets, check out
[angularjs-snippets](https://github.com/magnars/angular-snippets.el).

There are two modes:

* angular-mode
* angular-html-mode

*angular-mode* provides font-lock syntax highlighting for JavaScript
files and is derived from js-mode.

*angular-html-mode* provides font-lock syntax highlighting for HTML
templates and is derived from html-mode.

In the future there should be a speedbar minor mode that lists
controllers, directives, services and filters defined in a file.
